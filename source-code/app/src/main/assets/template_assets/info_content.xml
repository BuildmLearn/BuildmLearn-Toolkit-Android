            <item_title>Love Story</item_title>
            <item_description>Eric Segal's book became a phenomenon with all romantics and
                eventually it was made into a movie. Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Neal brought the
                characters of Jennifer and Oliver to life in this tragic love story, where the rich
                boy abandons his lavish lifestyle to get married to the girl of his dreams. But
                Jenny suffers from cancer and the newly weds face a financial crunch. 'Love means
                never having to say you're sorry', became one of the most repeated lines of all
                times.

            <item_description>Titanic has been a blockbuster to beat them all. Topping most lists
                when it comes to romance, the sizzling chemistry between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate
                Winslet and the way they depicted love between the not-very-well-to-do-but-clever

                Awards, this movie has left a deep imprint in the minds of everybody who have known
